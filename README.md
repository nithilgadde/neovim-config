# neovim-config
my neovim config ported from NvChad

this port has a lot of features such as:
* cmp for code and the cmdline,
* debuggers (nvim-dap) for python (tested), c/c++ (not tested; fairly new addition), and rust (not tested; fairly new addition)
* vs-code type minimap
* breadcrumbs (nvim-navbuddy, nvim-navic, barbecue)
* lsp configs
